	#
	# This is the IP address that your host will communicate to the guest through. In the
	# case of the default `192.168.56.101` that we've provided, Virtualbox will setup another
	# network adapter on your host machine with the IP `192.168.13.1` as a gateway.
	#
	# If you are already on a network using the 192.168.13.x subnet, this should be changed.

	# for those as well. This includes other Vagrant boxes.

	# Local Machine Hosts
	#
	# If the Vagrant plugin Ghost (https://github.com/10up/vagrant-ghost) is
	# installed, the following will automatically configure your local machine's hosts file to
	# be aware of the domains specified below. Watch the provisioning script as you may need to
	# enter a password for Vagrant to access your hosts file.
	#
	# By default, we'll include the domains set up by Primary Vagrant through the pv-hosts file
	# located in the www/ directory.
	#
	# Other domains can be automatically added by including a pv-hosts file containing
	# individual domains separated by whitespace in subdirectories of www/.

	# machine versions. Think of it as two different ways to access the same file. When the
	# virtual machine is destroyed with `vagrant destroy`, your files will remain in your local
	# environment.

	# /var/www/
	#
	# For each project you're working on map a folder to it. The first argument is the location
	# on the host computer. The second argument is the location on the guest matching. Finally the
