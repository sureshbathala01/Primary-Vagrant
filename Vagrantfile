	# This is the IP address that your host will communicate to the guest through. In the
	# case of the default `192.168.56.101` that we've provided, Virtualbox will setup another
	# network adapter on your host machine with the IP `192.168.13.1` as a gateway.
	#
	# If you are already on a network using the 192.168.13.x subnet, this should be changed.

	# for those as well. This includes other Vagrant boxes.

	# Local Machine Hosts
	#
	# If the Vagrant plugin Ghost (https://github.com/10up/vagrant-ghost) is

	# be aware of the domains specified below. Watch the provisioning script as you may need to
	# enter a password for Vagrant to access your hosts file.
	#
	# By default, we'll include the domains set up by Primary Vagrant through the pv-hosts file
	# located in the www/ directory.
	#
	# Other domains can be automatically added by including a pv-hosts file containing
	# individual domains separated by whitespace in subdirectories of www/.

	# Drive mapping
	#

	# virtual machine to directories on your local machine. Once these are mapped, any
	# changes made to the files in these directories will affect both the local and virtual
	# machine versions. Think of it as two different ways to access the same file. When the
	# virtual machine is destroyed with `vagrant destroy`, your files will remain in your local
	# environment.

	# Custom Mappings - POSSIBLY UNSTABLE
	#
	# Use this to insert your own (and possibly rewrite) Vagrant config lines. Helpful
	# for mapping additional drives. If a file 'pv-mappings' exists in the www folder or any of its subfolders
	# it will be evaluated as ruby inline as it loads.

	# Provisioning
	#
	# Process one or more provisioning scripts depending on the existence of custom files.

	# Vagrant Triggers
	#

	# state changes like `vagrant up`, `vagrant halt`, `vagrant suspend`, and `vagrant destroy`
	#
	# These scripts are run on the host machine, so we use `vagrant ssh` to tunnel back
	# into the VM and execute things. By default, each of these scripts calls db_backup
	# to create backups of all current databases. This can be overridden with custom
	# scripting. See the individual files in config/homebin/ for details.
